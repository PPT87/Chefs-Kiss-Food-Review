## Background:
I love to eat. I happen to have tried a lot of foods in my life time and sadly as I get older and the foods keep piling on, I can't remember everything that i've tried. SO, I decided to make this app to keep track of the foods i've tried. I wanted to make a food first review app vs. a restaurant first review app. Why? I happen to find myself loving 1 dish at a restaurant but everything else was just...meh. If I were to review that restaurant as a 1 star, i'll probably forget about that 1 great dish.

## Description:
1.  When landing on the home page, sign in so that you can get started. If you try to access anything on the navbar, it'll just ask you to sign in also..so just do it!
2. After logging in, you'll be presented to your homepage. The homepage will display all of the foods that you've reviewed. If you happen to have no reviews, the prompt will let know to add one!
