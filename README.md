## Background:
I love to eat. I happen to have tried a lot of foods in my life time and sadly as I get older and the foods keep piling on, I can't remember everything that i've tried. SO, I decided to make this app to keep track of the foods i've tried. I wanted to make a food first review app vs. a restaurant first review app. Why? I happen to find myself loving 1 dish at a restaurant but everything else was just...meh. If I were to review that restaurant as a 1 star, i'll probably forget about that 1 great dish.
<br>

## Getting Started:
1.  When landing on the home page, sign in so that you can get started. If you try to access anything on the navbar, it'll just ask you to sign in also..so just do it!

2. After logging in, you'll be presented to your homepage. The homepage will display all of the foods that you've reviewed. If you happen to have no reviews, the prompt will let know to add one!

3. Along the navbar you can access your reviews at anytime my clicking on "My Reviews". Additionally, I also made the "kiss" icon to take you to your reviews.   

4. Add a new food review by clicking on "Add New Review". Here, you'll be presented a form where you can add in the food you tried, restaurant, location, rating, and an optional review. If you don't want to add in a review, you don't have to. Hit the "Submit" button and you'll be taken back to your homepage where you can see your review you just made!

5. If you want to delete an item, you can click on the trashcan icon in red when in the homepage.  If you click on the blue info button, it will take you to the details page of that food review. 

6. In the details page, you'll see the food description in the top card and then the reviews below it.  If you want to add in additional reviews, say, you went back to try it again for second thoughts, this is where you'd do it!

7. You can also edit the food info by clicking on the edit button on the lower right hand corner of the top card. Say you misspelled something or wanted to change your overall rating on your homepage, you can edit it.

8. If you click on the "Community Page" you'll be presented with other Kissers.  You can click on each profile to see their reviews and also see the details of each review! You might be inspired to try something new and unique.
